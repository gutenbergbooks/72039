WOOLLY DOG</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br>
<span class="fs80">POOR TOYS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Well, he certainly is the finest toy in
my little shop, but what good does that
do if I can’t sell him? His wool is very
soft, and he looks so natural that I can
almost hear him bark. But, oh dear! if
I don’t sell him—or sell some of the toys
soon—I can’t pay my rent and I’ll be
turned out! Oh, if my boy Jimmie would
only come home from the sea with the
gold he said he’d bring to me!”</p>

<p>A sad-faced, poor, little, old lady moved
slowly about a poor little store on a side
street. In the small show window were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
a few notions—pins, needles and thread,
and a few toys.</p>

<p>On a shelf near the window were other
toys. But they were a very poor and
cheap lot, made to sell to poor children
who had only a few pennies. There were
dolls that cost five cents—dolls with only
a thin little calico dress on, and nothing
else. There were jumping jacks that
could be had for as little as three pennies,
and there were two-cent tops and one-cent
marbles.</p>

<p>“The Woolly Dog is the best toy of
all,” went on Mrs. Clark, who kept the
little store. “The agent said I could sell
him for a good sum and make money on
him. Certainly he is a fine toy and I did
not have to pay very much, and, since I
gave him a bath and cleaned him, he
looks good enough to be in a rich store.</p>

<p>“But, oh dear! I don’t know! If I
don’t sell something soon I don’t know
where I’m going to make up the rent
money! Oh, this is a hard world!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Clark sat down on a stool
behind the counter and waited for customers
to come in. But there was little
buying that day. Christmas had passed,
and though she had done pretty well in
trade around the holidays, now but few
children, or grown-ups, either, came in to
spend their money. Perhaps they had
spent it all for Christmas gifts.</p>

<p>“If I could only sell the Woolly Dog!”
sighed Mrs. Clark again, and she wiped
some tears from her eyes, for she was very
sad and in trouble.</p>

<p>“I wish I could help her,” thought the
Woolly Dog to himself. He did not dare
speak out loud, though he could talk in
toy language when no real persons were
near by. “Yes, I wish I could help her,
but I can’t go out and sell myself, or I
would. This isn’t the kind of a store
where rich customers will come.”</p>

<p>The Woolly Dog looked around at the
poor toys on the same shelf with him. He
was the most expensive of the lot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>As Mrs. Clark had said, some time ago,
when she bought her little stock of toys
from an agent, he had offered her this
Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>“It’s a sample, Mrs. Clark,” said the
man. “I have carried him around in my
satchel for a long time, and his white
wool is rather dirty. But he isn’t broken,
and if you were to wash him with soap
and water he’d be as clean as a whistle.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of whistles,” said Mrs.
Clark, “the last ones I got from you
didn’t whistle loud enough, some boys
said. They brought them back and I had
to return them their pennies.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have some louder whistles
now,” went on the agent. “And I’ll allow
you for the ones that didn’t sell. But
what about this Woolly Dog? I’ll let
you have him cheap. You can wash him,
put him in the window, and I’m sure
you’ll sell him. You should ask a good
price, too, for this is one of the most expensive
toys on the market.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>“All right, I’ll take him,” said Mrs.
Clark.</p>

<p>And so she had bought the Woolly Dog.
She had washed him, putting him right
into a tub with soap and warm water.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was a terrible time for me!”
said the Woolly Dog, telling of it afterward
to his friend, the three-cent Jumping
Jack. “I surely thought I would drown,
and the soap got in my eyes! Burr-r-r-r!”</p>

<p>“If that had happened to me all my
paint would have washed off,” said the
three-cent Jumping Jack, one of the very
cheapest of the poor toys.</p>

<p>You see the toys could talk among
themselves when no children or grown-ups
were there to listen.</p>

<p>“Well, I felt dreadfully about it for a
while,” went on the Woolly Dog. “But
after Mrs. Clark had washed me nicely
she put me in the warm sun and I dried
out.”</p>

<p>“You are quite white and fluffy now,”
said the Jumping Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I believe I am considered a very
good sort of toy,” admitted the Woolly
Dog, trying not to speak proudly. “I
am made of real lamb’s wool, you know.”</p>

<p>“I can see that,” put in a Calico-Dressed
Doll, who sold for five cents—very
little for a doll, I’m sure. “It is
very nice of you to stay here among such
poor toys as we are,” went on the Doll.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think it is quite jolly here!”
barked the Woolly Dog. “It’s such a cute
little store, you know!”</p>

<p>“But Mrs. Clark does hardly any business,”
said the Jumping Jack. “I was
one of the lot of a dozen she bought from
the agent, and there are eight of us left.
She’ll never get rich selling toys, I’m
afraid.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” agreed the Woolly
Dog. “But if she could sell me and get
the price I ought to bring, she would have
several dollars. I ought to be sold for five
dollars, but I heard the agent say she
could let me go for three.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>“Three dollars! Think of that!” exclaimed
the Calico-Dressed Doll. “That’s
almost a million, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Almost, but not quite,” answered the
Woolly Dog, and again he did not speak
proudly as some toys might have done.</p>

<p>So it had come about that the Woolly
Dog was among the poor toys in Mrs.
Clark’s little store—the best toy of all, it
might be said of the Woolly Dog. Mrs.
Clark knew this, and she hoped the Woolly
Dog would soon sell, so she might get
enough money to make up the full amount
for the rent, which must be paid in a day
or two.</p>

<p>“I need just that three dollars the
Woolly Dog would bring,” sighed the
poor old lady. “Or if my son Jimmie
would come home, he would pay the
rent.”</p>

<p>But Jimmie was a sailor lad and at this
time was far away, on a sort of treasure
hunt. He hoped to come back with gold
to give his mother, and he had written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
some letters in which he said he might be
home almost any day now.</p>

<p>“But my eyes are weary watching for
him,” sighed Mrs. Clark.</p>

<p>She moved about her store, looking at
the few things she had to sell. After her
husband had died she had started the
store. For a time she did fairly well,
but times grew hard and she lived in a
poor neighborhood, where few people had
money to spend on toys. They bought
needles, thread and pins of Mrs. Clark,
but there is not much money to be had
selling these.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll put the Woolly Dog back
in the window,” said Mrs. Clark to herself,
after dusting her store for the day.
“He will be seen better there, but I don’t
like to keep him in the window too long,
for the sun might take the curl out of his
wool. But I’ll put him there this afternoon
and leave him there to-morrow.
Maybe someone will see him and buy him.
True, I’ve had him in the window before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
and no one even came in to ask how much
he would cost. But I’ll try it again.”</p>

<p>The Woolly Dog was glad to hear Mrs.
Clark say this, for he liked being in the
show window. There was more to be
seen from the window—he could watch
the children playing in the street and hear
their laughter.</p>

<p>Of course he liked being on the shelf
with the other toys, but he felt, deep down
inside him, that it would be best for him
to be sold so Mrs. Clark could get the
money for her rent.</p>

<p>“Into the window you go, my friend!”
said the storekeeper lady, as she patted
the Woolly Dog to get out of his coat any
dust that might make him look dingy.
“Into the window you go, and may someone
buy you!”</p>

<p>Not long after the Dog had been placed
in the window with the needles, pins and
spools of thread, a boy and a girl pressed
their little noses up against the glass,
making them look quite flat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, see the new dog in the window!”
cried the girl.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t a new dog. I’ve seen him before,”
said the boy.</p>

<p>“Well, he looks new to me,” went on
the girl. “I wonder how much he costs.”</p>

<p>“I guess more’n a dollar, Lizzie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he couldn’t!” gasped the little
girl. “No toy could cost that much—not
ever, Sammie!”</p>

<p>“Pooh! You just ought to see some of
the toys in the stores on Main Street!”
replied Sammie. “Why, I’ve seen price
tickets on ’em marked—<em>ten dollars</em>!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sammie! No!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have! Say, rich people don’t
care what they spend for toys!”</p>

<p>“Oh, it must be lovely to be rich,”
sighed Lizzie. “But, anyhow, we can
<em>wish</em> we had this Woolly Dog.”</p>

<p>“A lot of good that will do!” muttered
Sammie. “Come on, we have to go to the
store for half a pound of sugar. We
haven’t any money for toys.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“No, I s’pose not,” sighed his sister.
“Good-bye, Woolly Dog!” she called back
to the toy in the window, waving her hand.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed. Though many
children of the neighborhood looked in
Mrs. Clark’s window—some of the boys
and girls wishing they might buy the
Woolly Dog—no one purchased the expensive
toy.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” sighed Mrs. Clark, when
night came and she had to close her store
without having sold the Woolly Dog. “I
don’t know what I’m going to do if I don’t
get the rent money!”</p>

<p>With the coming of night a change took
place among the toys. When the store
window curtain was pulled down, the
doors closed and when Mrs. Clark had
gone to bed, wishing she might dream of
her son, there was a movement among the
Dolls, the Jumping Jacks and the Wooden
Animals in the cheap Noah’s Arks.</p>

<p>“I say, Woolly Dog!” called a voice,
“are you ready for some fun?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>“Of course I am,” answered the Woolly
Dog. “What do you want to do?”</p>

<p>“Will you give me a ride on your
back?” asked a little Rubber Clown, who
had a whistle in his back that squeaked
when you squeezed him.</p>

<p>“Surely, I’ll give you a ride on my
back,” said the Woolly Dog kindly.
“Where are you?”</p>

<p>“Up on the shelf over your head. Wait
a minute and I’ll jump down,” said the
Rubber Clown.</p>

<p>“Oh, now for some fun!” exclaimed the
Calico-Dressed Doll.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br>
<span class="fs80">A RICH MAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Get ready down there! I’m coming!”
called the Rubber Clown to the Woolly
Dog. “Is your back strong enough to
hold me if I jump?”</p>

<p>“Indeed it is,” answered the Dog.
“And I’ll give you a fine ride around the
show window.”</p>

<p>If you have read some of the other
books in these Make Believe Stories you
know that the toys told about could pretend
to come to life, move about and play
among themselves, as well as talk. But
of course all this must be done when no
human eyes see them.</p>

<p>And as Mrs. Clark had gone to bed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
as her son Jimmie, the sailor lad, was far
away at sea, there was no one to spy on
the Woolly Dog, the Rubber Clown, or the
other playthings. They could do as they
pleased during the night.</p>

<p>“Well, here I come!” cried the Rubber
Clown. He was fat, jolly and good-natured
even though he was a poor toy,
selling for only five cents. And, though
he had a tin whistle in his back, he was
not at all proud.</p>

<p>The Rubber Clown moved over to the
edge of the shelf on which he had been
standing for several weeks, as no one
seemed to care to buy him. Below him
was the platform—or floor—of the show
window, where, at this time, the Woolly
Dog was the only toy.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” barked the Woolly
Dog, as he looked up at the Clown, who
was about to jump.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” the Rubber
Clown wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I want to move over a little closer to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
you,” went on the Dog. “You might not
land on my back where I am.”</p>

<p>The Dog, who had fat little stuffed legs,
moved them slowly to and fro, and walked
over just beneath the end of the toy
shelf.</p>

<p>“One,” began the Clown, counting before
he leaped. “Two——”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” barked the Woolly
Dog again.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter now?” the Clown
asked.</p>

<p>“Mind the needles and pins,” warned
the Dog. “If you land on them you’ll be
stuck.”</p>

<p>“I intend to land on your soft, woolly
back,” laughed the Clown. “Three!” he
cried, finishing his count. “Here I
come!”</p>

<p>With that he toppled off the shelf, turning
two somersaults as he went down,
for he was quite an acrobat, was this
Clown.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t that perfectly wonderful?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
gasped one Calico-Dressed Doll to another.</p>

<p>“Gorgeous!” was the reply. “It’s as
good as going to a circus. I didn’t know
the Rubber Clown could turn somersaults.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! You ought to see <em>me</em> somersault!”
boasted one of the cheap Jumping
Jacks. “If I could get rid of this
stick and the strings that jiggle my legs
I’d show you some somersaulting!”</p>

<p>The Jumping Jack was afraid lest the
Calico-Dressed Dolls think too much of
the Rubber Clown. The Jumping Jack
was a bit jealous, I’m thinking.</p>

<p>Down, down, down, went the Clown,
turning over and over as he aimed to
land on the Woolly Dog’s back to get a
ride.</p>

<p>“Hi! Yi!” yelled the Rubber Clown,
in toy language of course. “Here I
come!”</p>

<p>“He’s a great trickster,” said a little
Penny China Doll.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>Then the Rubber Clown did a trick he
had not counted on. He missed landing
on the Woolly Dog’s back and hit the floor
of the show window with both feet. And,
being made of rubber, the Clown did just
what I think you have guessed he did—he
bounced high up in the air. Up he
bounded!</p>

<p>“Hold on there! I say! what are you
doing?” cried the Woolly Dog. “I
thought you were going to ride on my
back!”</p>

<p>“I—thought—so—too!” gasped the
Clown. He had to speak in jerks because
his breath was bounced out of him.</p>

<p>The Rubber Clown bounded nearly as
high as the shelf from which he had turned
a somersault and then down to the floor
of the window he went again.</p>

<p>“Come on—get up on my back!” barked
the Dog.</p>

<p>The Clown tried, but he could not. Up
in the air he sprang again, like a rubber
ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t this exciting!” cried the
Penny China Doll.</p>

<p>“I should say it was!” agreed the
Jumping Jack. “It’s the best fun I’ve
seen in a long while.”</p>

<p>“It may be—fun for—you,” gasped the
Clown. “But it—isn’t any—fun for—me!”</p>

<p>Up and down he bounced, a little less
and a little slower each time until at last
he bounded only as high as the Woolly
Dog’s back.</p>

<p>“Now’s your chance. I’ll run under
you and you can sit on me!” barked the
fluffy toy.</p>

<p>And that’s just what he did. When the
Clown was up in the air the Woolly Dog
moved over a bit and stood squarely beneath
the Clown. Down came the rubber
toy, landing safely on the Dog’s back.
He bounced up a little, but not much, for
you know rubber will not rebound from
anything soft, like a bed. And the Dog’s
back was even softer than a hair mattress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“Now I’m all right,” laughed the
Clown. “I thought I’d never get here,
though. But here I am! Start off, if
you please, Woolly Dog. But wait a
minute! I’ll blow my whistle!”</p>

<p>The Rubber Clown made a low bow,
compressing the air inside his hollow
body just as if he had been squeezed. Out
through the tin hole in his back rushed the
air, making a whistling sound. The other
toys laughed and the Woolly Dog barked,
and then he trotted around and gave the
Rubber Clown a fine ride in the show
window.</p>

<p>Light came in from a street lamp
through a crack in the window curtain,
so the toys could see to play about. And
fine fun they had! After the Clown had
been given a ride, the Dog kindly let some
of the Dolls get up on his back and, much
to their delight, he paraded them around.</p>

<p>The Jumping Jacks did some tricks
and the Animals from the Noah’s Ark
marched around like a circus procession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>But at last the Clown cried:</p>

<p>“Daylight is coming! To your places,
all of you!”</p>

<p>For the coming of daylight meant that
Mrs. Clark would open the store for the
day’s business, and then the toys could
neither speak nor move, for human eyes
would see them.</p>

<p>Up to his shelf leaped the Rubber
Clown, the Calico-Dressed Dolls laid
themselves out straight in their boxes.
The Penny China Doll took her place
near the Tops and the Woolly Dog walked
to the middle of the show window where
he had been put so passersby would best
notice him.</p>

<p>The store became lighter. The street
lamps were put out one by one, and the
sun began to shine.</p>

<p>“Another day has begun,” said Mrs.
Clark, as she entered her store to raise the
curtain. “I certainly hope I do more
business to-day than I did yesterday.
Rent time is coming very near and I need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
three dollars! If I could only sell the
Woolly Dog!”</p>

<p>She put her tiny stock of toys and
goods in order, got her breakfast and then
sat down to wait for two things. One was
the postman who, she hoped, would bring
her a letter from her sailor son. The
other was for customers, especially a customer
who would buy the Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>It was almost noon when a man passed
through the street on which Mrs. Clark’s
store stood. This man wore very good
clothes, and he carried a cane with a gold
head. He looked to be a very rich man,
and he was.</p>

<p>“But I don’t see why a rich man is
walking through our poor street,” said
Lizzie to Sammie.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s looking for a washerwoman
for his wife,” suggested Sammie.
Many came to the street for that purpose.</p>

<p>However, Mr. Theodore Blakeley, for
that was his name, had not come to Hoyt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
Street to look for a laundress. He had
never been in that street before—in fact,
he hardly knew its name or that there was
such a street—and his coming to it was a
sort of accident.</p>

<p>That morning he had started out in his
automobile to go down town to business.
He did not like to travel in trolley cars,
and as for a jitney, he had never ridden
in one in his life!</p>

<p>But even rich men, in autos, have their
troubles, and the trouble that came to Mr.
Blakeley was that, half way to his office,
something made a hole in one of the tires.
It was punctured near Hoyt Street, where
Mrs. Clark had her shop.</p>

<p>“I shall have to change a tire, sir,” said
the chauffeur, touching his hat to Mr.
Blakeley.</p>

<p>“Hum! That means delay, I suppose.
I think I’ll walk on. It isn’t far, is it,
James?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not if you take the short cut
through Hoyt Street.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>“All right, I’ll do it. Come for me this
evening, as usual.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>So the rich Mr. Blakeley alighted
from his automobile and started to walk
through Hoyt Street—a place where, as
far as he could remember, he had never
before been. It was not often that rich
and well-dressed men were seen there.</p>

<p>And, as it happened, Mr. Blakeley
passed Mrs. Clark’s poor little store.
And just then the sun shone on the Woolly
Dog—on his clean, white, curling coat of
lamb’s wool.</p>

<p>“Bless me!” exclaimed Mr. Blakeley,
for he was rather an old-fashioned gentleman.
“Bless me! There’s the very thing
for Donald’s birthday! It will save me
going down town.”</p>

<p>Donald Cressey was the son of Mr.
Blakeley’s sister, and the boy was a great
favorite of his uncle. Mr. Blakeley’s sister
was not as rich as was he, and she
could not afford to buy expensive presents.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
But Mr. Blakeley always saw to it
that on Donald’s birthday and at Christmas
the boy had something nice.</p>

<p>“Yes, that Woolly Dog will just do for
Donald,” went on Mr. Blakeley. “He
can’t hurt himself with it, and he can
have lots of fun. I’m glad I remembered
it was his birthday—came near forgetting
it. And it’s lucky I happened to walk
through this street. I didn’t know they
kept toys here. I’ll go in and get that
Dog.”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Blakeley opened the door of
Mrs. Clark’s poor little store and went
inside.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE WOOLLY DOG’S NEW HOME</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Something I can do for you?” asked
Mrs. Clark, “all in a flutter,” she said
afterward to her neighbor, Mrs. Elkton,
who kept a little grocery store. “The
idea,” said Mrs. Clark, “of a rich gentleman
like him walking into my poor little
place!”</p>

<p>“That Woolly Dog in your window,”
answered Mr. Blakeley. “I’ll take it.
My nephew’s birthday,” he added, with a
smile. Perhaps he thought if he didn’t
say this that Mrs. Clark might think he
wanted the Woolly Dog for himself.
“Wrap it up, please.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Clark was still “all in a flutter.”
Never before, in all the years that she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
kept store, had anyone bought anything
of her without asking the price. And
often, when she told them the price, little
as it was, the customer walked out without
buying.</p>

<p>And Mr. Blakeley had said:</p>

<p>“I’ll take it!”</p>

<p>Just like that—poof!</p>

<p>Mrs. Clark reached over in the show
window and picked up the Woolly Dog.
She held him firmly in her hand, for her
fingers trembled a bit and she did not
want to drop the white, clean toy in the
dust.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wonder what is going to happen
to me?” thought the Woolly Dog, as he
felt himself lifted up. “I think there is
going to be a great change! Goodness
knows I hope so! I hope I’m sold, for
Mrs. Clark’s sake. Poor woman, she
needs the money I’ll bring.</p>

<p>“Though I shall feel sad at leaving my
friends, the poor toys, still, I was shut up
in the agent’s sample valise so long that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
really, I have had no adventures worth
speaking about. Now I feel I am to see
life.” So thought the Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>“This is—er—rather an expensive
toy,” said Mrs. Clark slowly, as she
smoothed the Dog’s wool. “Though it is
considered one of the best. The price—er—the
price—is—<em>three dollars</em>!”</p>

<p>She almost whispered those last two
words, so fearful was she of shocking Mr.
Blakeley.</p>

<p>“Eh—what’s that?” he asked, for he
was a trifle deaf.</p>

<p>“The price is—<em>three dollars</em>! I’m
afraid that’s rather expensive. I don’t
carry much in that line—not in this neighborhood—but
really I ought to get three
dollars for the Dog and——”</p>

<p>“Why, you’re <em>going</em> to get three dollars
for him,” chuckled Mr. Blakeley. “I
never try to beat down a price. It looks
worth it to me. I’ve seen some no better
on Main Street that were marked five dollars.
I think I’m getting a bargain. Donald<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
will like it, I’m sure. Wrap it up,
please, I’m in a hurry—my car broke
down.”</p>

<p>With fingers that still trembled, Mrs.
Clark wrapped the Woolly Dog in paper
and tied it about with cord.</p>

<p>“Hum! This isn’t very pleasant,”
thought the Woolly Dog to himself. “But
I suppose it can’t last forever. When I
get to Donald’s house—wherever that may
be—I am sure my adventures will begin.
But I wish I could have said good-bye to
the poor toys.”</p>

<p>The poor toys themselves wished they
might bid farewell to their expensive
friend, the Woolly Dog, but it could not
be. They dared not move or speak while
human eyes were watching.</p>

<p>“There you are, madam, three dollars,”
murmured Mr. Blakeley, as he passed
over some crisp bills. “And I’m sure I’m
quite pleased to get this toy for Donald.
Good-morning!”</p>

<p>And out he walked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>“But, my stars! you should have seen
the money in his pocketbook when he
opened it to pay me the three dollars,”
said Mrs. Clark afterward. “Honestly,
I never knew men carried so much! But
I’m thankful to get the three, as I needed
just them to make up my rent. Now I
won’t worry for another month, and by
that time Jimmie may come home with
the gold he is always talking about.” And
a few weeks later Jimmie came home and
his mother was no longer poor, for the
sailor lad had found gold.</p>

<p>Humming to himself a little song, and
quite pleased with his early morning
shopping, even though the day had started
with an accident to his automobile, Mr.
Blakeley kept on through Hoyt Street
with the paper parcel containing the
Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>“Oh, Sammie! He’s bought it!” cried
a girl’s voice.</p>

<p>“Who’s bought what?” asked her
brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“The rich man has bought the big
Woolly Dog from Mrs. Clark,” answered
Lizzie. “I saw her take it out of the window
and a man has it.”</p>

<p>“He has? Well, I’ll buy one like it
some day when I get rich!” joked Sammie.
“Hey, Timmie,” he went on, calling
to another boy, “come on over. I know
where there’s a dandy mud puddle!”</p>

<p>Mr. Blakeley, unaware of all the stir
he had caused in that poor Hoyt Street by
buying so costly a toy, kept on to his office.
He was a very important man in business
and he found clerks, secretaries and stenographers
waiting for him to start the
day’s affairs.</p>

<p>But, first of all, after he had taken off
his hat, Mr. Blakeley handed to his private
secretary the bundle he had brought
from Mrs. Clark’s store.</p>

<p>“Take good care of that,” said the rich
man to his secretary, Miss Moore.
“There’s a dog in it!”</p>

<p>“A dog, Mr. Blakeley? Oh——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” he chuckled. “But don’t be
afraid. He can’t bite! Wait, I’ll show
him to you.”</p>

<p>He opened one end of the paper parcel
and let the Woolly Dog be seen.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t he cute!” exclaimed Miss
Moore, with a smile. Then she looked
rather strangely at her employer.</p>

<p>“It isn’t for me,” went on Mr. Blakeley,
with another chuckle. “It’s Donald’s
birthday and I’m going to stop at his
house this afternoon. Please don’t let me
forget this Dog when James comes for
me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll remind you, Mr. Blakeley.”</p>

<p>Then the day’s work began in Mr.
Blakeley’s office. Clerks came and went,
other business men dropped in to talk over
money matters, and through it all the
Woolly Dog lay wrapped in the paper on
Mr. Blakeley’s desk. Once, when the
wind started to blow away a bundle of
checks, Miss Moore put the Woolly Dog
on them as a weight to hold them down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>But the Woolly Dog knew nothing of
this, though, even if he had known that he
was guarding thousands of dollars I do
not believe he would have been proud.</p>

<p>He was a very good and sensible Woolly
Dog.</p>

<p>At last the business day came to an end.
Mr. Blakeley finished signing papers and
dictating letters. He reached for his hat
when the porter came in to say that James
and the automobile were outside.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget the Woolly Dog!” called
Miss Moore, as she saw Mr. Blakeley about
to leave his office without the bundle.</p>

<p>“Bless me! I should say not!” he
cried. “Donald wouldn’t know what to
think if I drove up on his birthday without
a present! Come on, Doggie,” and he
whistled a little, pretending that the
Woolly Dog in the parcel was alive.</p>

<p>Miss Moore laughed to see her employer
so jolly. As for the plaything,
well, the Woolly Dog was alive, in a way,
for he could hear the whistle, though of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
course he dared not bark in answer.</p>

<p>“Now I am traveling again,” thought
the Dog to himself, as he felt Mr. Blakeley
carrying him out to the car. James had
mended the puncture and had called at the
rich man’s office as he did every afternoon.</p>

<p>“Home, sir?” asked James, touching
his cap as he closed the door after Mr.
Blakeley had entered the car.</p>

<p>“No, to my sister’s house. You know
where it is, James?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“It’s Donald’s birthday,” explained
Mr. Blakeley, and the chauffeur smiled as
he caught a glimpse, through the torn
paper, of the Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>Donald Cressey lived with his father
and mother in a pleasant little house just
outside the big city, and when Donald’s
mother saw her brother’s large car coming
to a stop in front of her home she
called:</p>

<p>“Oh, Donald, here’s Uncle Teddy!”</p>

<p>“Has he brought my birthday present?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
asked the little boy, as he eagerly
raced to the door.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t expect Uncle Teddy to
bring you a present each birthday,” replied
his mother, for she did not want
Donald to look for too much.</p>

<p>“Oh, but he <em>always</em> brings me something
when I get a year older,” the boy
murmured. “Don’t you think he will this
time?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cressey did not answer. She was
watching her brother get out of his car.
And then she and Donald, at the same
time, saw the paper bundle.</p>

<p>“Oh, he has it! He has it!” cried Donald,
jumping up and down for joy. A
moment later he was in his uncle’s arms
and was trying to loosen the paper and
string from around the present.</p>

<p>And when he saw the pretty, white
Woolly Dog the boy cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s just what I wanted! Now
I can have some fun!”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t get it dirty,” warned his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
mother. “It is a beautiful dog, Teddy,”
she said to her brother. “But Donald
must not soil it. Be careful—don’t drop
it.”</p>

<p>“The Dog will wash. The lady I bought
it of said so,” went on Donald’s uncle.
“She washed it herself once, she said. I
guess Donald won’t hurt it. Let him play
with it and have a good time.”</p>

<p>And Donald certainly had a good time
with the Woolly Dog. He hugged it close
to him, and squeezed it hard, but the
Woolly Dog did not mind that, for he was
stuffed with soft cotton and could stand
a great deal of squeezing.</p>

<p>“He seems to like it,” said Donald’s
mother. “You were very kind to remember
him, Teddy.”</p>

<p>“I thought of his birthday this morning
when I happened to pass a toy store,”
and Mr. Blakeley told about walking
through Hoyt Street.</p>

<p>Donald thanked his uncle, and then
showed him some of the other presents he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
had received. One was a little toy train
of cars, and when Donald was telling his
uncle that they would run on a tin track,
suddenly the door of the room burst
open and in rushed a little golden-haired
creature with bright, flashing eyes. She
caught sight of the new gift and cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, I wants Woolly Dog! I wants
him! I hab him!”</p>

<p>And before Donald could save his new
toy, his little sister, Jane, caught up the
Woolly Dog in her arms and ran out of
the room.</p>

<p>“Here! Come back! Come back with
my Woolly Dog!” shouted Donald, but
Jane ran down the hall.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="fs80">WHAT LITTLE JANE DID</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Jane, who was Donald’s little sister,
did not exactly know what she was going
to do with the Woolly Dog which she had
picked up so quickly and run away with.
Jane was like that—she often took Donald’s
toys and tried to keep them for herself,
for she was too small to know any
better.</p>

<p>Often Donald, being a kind boy, would
let his little sister keep the things she
took—at least, he would let her play with
them until he wanted them, and by that
time Jane was tired of them and wanted
something else.</p>

<p>This time the little girl had seen Donald’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
new Woolly Dog and had used her
chance to get it. She thought perhaps she
could go to a room by herself and play
with the new toy. But Donald was too
quick for her. Down the hall after his
sister he ran, still shouting:</p>

<p>“Come back with my Dog! Come back
with my Dog!”</p>

<p>“Jane! Jane! You mustn’t take Donald’s
new birthday gift!” exclaimed Mrs.
Cressey.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t take it away from her,”
begged Uncle Teddy. “I’ll get Donald a
new one.”</p>

<p>“No, that must not be,” said Mrs. Cressey.
“Jane must learn that certain things
belong to Donald and others to her. She
will grow up to be a selfish little girl if I
let her have her way too much. Jane,
Jane, come back with Donald’s Dog,
please!”</p>

<p>But Jane did not come back. She ran
into one room, out through a side door,
and down another hall, all the while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
clutching the Woolly Dog close in her
arms. After her ran her mother, Donald,
and even Uncle Teddy, who was laughing
and chuckling in glee.</p>

<p>“Even if Jane is a little bad, I haven’t
had so much fun in a long while,” thought
Mr. Blakeley to himself. “She’s a regular
tyke, that’s what she is. Ha! Ha!
She certainly can run! The little tyke!”</p>

<p>And run with the Woolly Dog, Jane
surely did. As for that toy, he did not
know what to think, and of course he could
say or do nothing while Jane had him.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” thought the Woolly Dog,
“I’m afraid I’m not going to have as
much fun here as I had hoped. I might
better have been left in Mrs. Clark’s little
store, poor as it was. At least it was
peaceable and quiet there.”</p>

<p>But other and more dreadful things
were to happen to the Woolly Dog. His
adventures were just beginning. Jane
squeezed him so tightly that, had he been
a real dog, he would have howled with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
pain. But, being only a Woolly Dog,
stuffed with cotton, he dared not cry out.
Perhaps if there had been a squeaker in
him, or a tin whistle, such as was in the
Rubber Clown, he might have made a
noise.</p>

<p>But, as it was, the Woolly Dog kept
silent, and at last Jane ran with him into
another room, slammed the door and
looked around. What was she going to
do next, the Woolly Dog wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“I hide, ’at’s what I do; I hide!” said
little Jane to herself. “I hide, an’ Woolly
Dog hide. Den dey tan’t find us!” She
was so excited that she talked “baby talk,”
of which her mother had almost cured
her.</p>

<p>In another moment the little girl had
seen a good place to hide—under the
couch in the room where she had run to
get away from Donald, her mother and
Uncle Teddy. Under the couch, still
closely hugging the Woolly Dog, rolled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
little Jane. She laughed and chuckled to
herself to think how she would fool those
looking for her.</p>

<p>And fool them she did, for, a moment
later, into the room hurried the three—Donald
in the lead, then his mother, and
lastly Uncle Teddy, who was puffing and
blowing, for he was rather fat and rather
old and not used to running.</p>

<p>“Jane! Jane! Where are you?
Where’s my Woolly Dog?” cried Donald.</p>

<p>Jane, under the conch, did not answer.</p>

<p>“She isn’t in here, I guess,” said
Mother Cressey.</p>

<p>“She came in here,” said Uncle Teddy.
“I heard the door slam.”</p>

<p>“She must have gone out again,” went
on Donald’s mother. “She’s a little rascal,
that’s what Jane is, sometimes. And
when she wants to, she can be as good as
gold—or pie.”</p>

<p>“Pie is better than gold,” chuckled
Uncle Teddy. “I wish you could give me
a piece, Mabel,” he said. “No pie I get,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
even in the best restaurants, is like
yours.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you some,” said his sister.</p>

<p>“After we find Jane,” he suggested.
“Maybe she’ll want some, too.”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Donald. “But first I want
my Woolly Dog.”</p>

<p>“Jane shouldn’t have taken it,” said
his mother. “Jane! Jane! Where are
you?” she called again.</p>

<p>But Jane, hidden under the couch with
the Woolly Dog, did not answer, and, as
the couch had a covering on, which came
nearly to the floor, she could not be
seen.</p>

<p>“I guess she ran up to the playroom,”
said Donald.</p>

<p>Jane wanted to laugh out loud as she
thought how she was fooling them all.
And, to keep from laughing, by which
sound they would know where she was, the
little girl stuffed into her mouth the tail
of the Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>For a time this held back her laugh, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
the fuzzy tail tickled Jane, and she felt
like sneezing. However, she held back the
sneeze and did not “ker-choo” until she
heard those who were looking for her
leave the room. Then Jane laughed and
sneezed.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” thought the Woolly Dog,
“I’m glad she didn’t sneeze when she had
my tail in her mouth! She might have
bitten it off. Oh, but what is going to happen?
So much excitement! It wouldn’t
be like this in the store if I had lived there
for a whole year!”</p>

<p>But more was yet to come.</p>

<p>Jane, under the couch, listened until she
was sure no one was in the room but herself
and the Woolly Dog. Sometimes
Donald played a trick on her when she
was hiding by pretending to go out of the
room where she was and then tiptoeing
back softly to be ready to catch her.</p>

<p>So Jane peeped out from under the
edge of the couch and then, making sure
no one was in sight, she rolled out as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
had rolled under, with the Woolly Dog in
her arms.</p>

<p>“My goodness!” thought the toy, “if
she rolls much more I’ll get as dizzy as
if I had chased my tail.”</p>

<p>But Jane did not intend to do much
rolling. She had another plan in her
queer little head. So, once out from under
the couch, she looked around for something
she wanted.</p>

<p>Jane had run into the sewing room in
her flight to get away from Donald and
keep her brother’s birthday Dog. And
in the sewing room were needles, pins,
spools of thread and many things such as
were in the window of Mrs. Clark’s store.</p>

<p>“Well, I feel quite at home here,”
thought the Woolly Dog, as he looked
around and saw the needles and pins.
But these were not what Jane wanted.
She found what she was looking for in
her mother’s sewing basket—a pair of
sharp, shining scissors.</p>

<p>Jane picked up the scissors and sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
down on the floor with the Woolly Dog
in her lap. There was a serious look on
the little girl’s face.</p>

<p>“Now I see where it is,” she whispered
to herself. “Now I find out all ’bout
you!”</p>

<p>The Woolly Dog saw the points of the
sharp, shining scissors in the chubby
hands of Jane coming nearer and nearer
to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, what dreadful thing is going to
happen now?” thought the Woolly Dog.
“Can she be going to cut me?”</p>

<p>He wanted to close his glass eyes, but
he dared not. He wanted to howl in terror,
but he dared not. He wanted to bark
and scare little Jane, but he dared not.</p>

<p>He dared do none of these things. He
dared not pretend to come to life while
the eyes of Jane were upon him. And she
was looking at him closely.</p>

<p>Jane turned the Woolly Dog over on his
back in her lap. She opened and closed
the scissors with a clashing sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“This is the end of me!” thought the
poor Woolly Dog. “Oh, if I were only
back in the store with the poor toys!”</p>

<p>“Now I see what’s inside you,” murmured
Jane.</p>

<p>“Snip!” went the sharp scissors, and
there was a long gash cut in the Woolly
Dog’s stomach, letting out some of the
cotton stuffing.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh, dear! Oh, dear me!” thought
the toy, but he dared not say a word or
utter so much as a whine.</p>

<p>“Snip!” went the scissors again, and
a longer gash was cut in the Woolly
Dog.</p>

<p>Jane leaned over to look at the mischief
she had done. She did not seem to be satisfied,
for she said:</p>

<p>“I dess I make hole bigger.”</p>

<p>“Snip!” went the scissors again.</p>

<p>The Woolly Dog thought he would
faint! But he was a very brave Dog, and
so he held his breath and stood it all without
even an inner shudder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“Now I dess I see what’s inside you,”
murmured Jane.</p>

<p>Down among the wads of cotton that
filled the inside of the Woolly Dog the little
girl poked her fingers. This way
and that she twisted them, and, oh,
how she tickled that poor little Woolly
Dog. You know how it feels to be
tickled on the outside of your ribs, but
how would you like to be tickled on the
inside?</p>

<p>Well, that’s what was happening to the
Woolly Dog. He was being tickled on the
inside!</p>

<p>How he wanted to laugh, in spite of his
pain, but he dared not.</p>

<p>“Where is it? I wonder where it is?”
said Jane over and over again, as her fingers
wiggled in among the wads of cotton
stuffing.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, the door of the sewing
room opened and in came Donald. He
gave one look at what Jane was doing, and
cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve found her! Oh, Mother, I’ve
found her!”</p>

<p>“Where is she?” asked his mother, for
they had been searching all over the house
for the mischievous little girl. “Where
is she, Donald?”</p>

<p>“She’s in the sewing room. And, oh,
Mother! she’s killed my Woolly Dog.
She’s killed him dead! Oh! Oh!” And
Donald burst into tears at the sight of his
birthday toy.</p>

</div>

<p>“Donald! Donald! What do you
mean? What has Jane done?” asked
Mrs. Cressey, as she followed closely after
her little boy and entered the room where
Jane had hidden.</p>

<p>“Look! Just look!” sobbed Donald,
with the tears streaming down his cheeks.
He was getting to be a big boy he thought,
and hated to cry, but this time he just
couldn’t help it. To have his new birthday
Woolly Dog cut up so soon after he
had received it from Uncle Teddy!
Wasn’t it sad?</p>

<p>Uncle Teddy himself, who had followed
Mrs. Cressey, came into the room. They
had searched all over the house for Jane,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
and at last her mother had thought perhaps
the little girl might have hidden
under the couch. Or, rather, it was Donald
who spoke of it. He said:</p>

<p>“Maybe she’s there. Sometimes she
hides there when we’re playing hide-and-seek.”</p>

<p>“We’ll look,” answered his mother.</p>

<p>So, back to this room they had gone
and there, of course, they had found
Jane.</p>

<p>At the sight of the sharp, shining scissors
and the cut dog lying in the little
girl’s lap, Mrs. Cressey exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, Jane! what are you doing?”</p>

<p>“I—I—now, I want to find the Woolly
Dog’s bark,” explained Jane.</p>

<p>“His <em>bark</em>?” cried her mother.</p>

<p>“Yes. I want to see if he’s got a bow-wow
inside him.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t,” said Donald, chokingly.
“There isn’t any bark in my Woolly Dog.
He doesn’t even squeak, does he, Uncle
Teddy?”</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>“No, I hardly think so. The storekeeper
didn’t say he did.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was lookin’ for his bark,” said
Jane, “but I didn’t find it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you’ve killed him—that’s
what you’ve done!” cried Donald.
“Jane, you’re a bad, bad girl! My
Woolly Dog is spoiled dead!”</p>

<p>“Never mind, I’ll get you another,”
said Uncle Teddy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cressey picked up the Woolly Dog
from her little girl’s lap. Some of the
cotton stuffing was sticking out of the
gash the scissors had made in his stomach.
Donald’s mother looked the Dog
over carefully.</p>

<p>“He isn’t much harmed,” she said. “I
can easily mend him, Donald.”</p>

<p>“Oh, can you, Mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can put the stuffing back in and
sew up the cut and he will be as good as
ever.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” asked Uncle Teddy.
“Because if you aren’t, I’ll get Donald<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
another dog, though this was the only one
in the store.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I can mend him,” said Mrs.
Cressey. “Jane didn’t do much damage,
after all.”</p>

<p>“Won’t the place show where you sew
him up?” asked Donald doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, it will show a little,” his mother
answered.</p>

<p>“But you can pretend your Dog has
been to the hospital and has had an operation,”
suggested Uncle Teddy.</p>

<p>“Oh, so I can! That will be fun!” replied
Donald, and he dried his tears.
“But Jane shouldn’t have cut him; should
she, Mother?”</p>

<p>“No, she was a naughty little girl, I’m
afraid.”</p>

<p>“I—now—I dess was lookin’ for his
bark,” said Jane, and her lips began to
quiver as they always did just before she
burst into tears.</p>

<p>“There, there!” soothed Uncle Teddy,
for he knew what was going to happen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
“I guess you didn’t intend to do it, Jane.
You won’t cut the Dog open again, will
you?”</p>

<p>“N-n-n-no,” promised Jane. “I won’t
cut him open to see him’s bark any more
’cause he hasn’t—now—got any!”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed Uncle Teddy.
“That’s right—he hasn’t any bark. But
don’t cut him open again anyhow, will
you?”</p>

<p>“No,” promised Jane. Then she
smiled.</p>

<p>And Donald smiled, too, for he knew
his Woolly Dog would be almost as good
as new when his mother had sewed it up
after putting back the stuffing.</p>

<p>“And now for my piece of pie, and then
I must get back home,” said Uncle Teddy.
“Happy birthday, Donald!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, and I wish you the same,”
said the little boy.</p>

<p>“So do I,” chimed in Jane. “An’ I—I—I’ll
give you a—kiss, Don,” and she
went over to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>Of course Donald had to forgive her
after that, and once more there was happiness.</p>

<p>“Things may not turn out so badly
after all, if they sew me up,” thought the
Woolly Dog. “But for a time I thought
my last hour had come. It’s been quite
an adventure, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“I’ll put your Dog in my sewing basket
until I get Uncle Teddy his piece of
pie,” said Mrs. Cressey to Donald. “Then
I’ll make him as good as ever for you.”</p>

<p>“Could I have some pie?” asked Jane.</p>

<p>“Well, you have been rather a naughty
little girl,” said her mother slowly. “But
as long as it’s Donald’s birthday we’ll forgive
you.”</p>

<p>While the pie was being served down
in the dining room the Woolly Dog lay
in the sewing basket in the work room, a
long gash in his stomach and the cotton
stuffing bulging out.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I need to go to the hospital,”
thought the Woolly Dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>Just then he heard a voice asking:</p>

<p>“Who are you and where did you come
from?”</p>

<p>Donald’s birthday toy looked around
and saw, gazing at him, a funny little Chinese
man, with queer, slanting eyes.</p>

<p>“I am a Woolly Dog, and I just came
from the store,” answered the new
plaything. “Who are you, if you
please?”</p>

<p>“I am a needle case,” was the answer.
“Mrs. Cressey keeps her needles in me.
I’m hollow inside. Are you?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the Woolly Dog. “I’m
stuffed with cotton, but some of it is coming
out.”</p>

<p>“So I see,” remarked the Chinese Man.
“I saw Jane cut you. She is a little
tyke—that girl! I’m glad I’m made of
hard china so she can’t cut me. My head
comes off. Does yours?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“Gracious, I should hope not!” barked
the Woolly Dog. Now that there were no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
human beings to see or hear he could pretend
to be alive.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps it wouldn’t be good to
have <em>your</em> head come off,” went on the
Chinese Man. “But, you see, I’m hollow
inside, and when Mrs. Cressey lifts off my
head there’s a place for her to drop her
sewing needles. I’m full of needles. Listen!”</p>

<p>The Chinese man jiggled himself up
and down and a queer rattling came from
within him.</p>

<p>“Don’t they tickle you—those needles?”
asked the Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>“Not a bit, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t they prick you with their sharp
points?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t mind them in the least.
That’s what it is to be made of hard china
like a plate or a cup and saucer.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so—yes,” agreed the Woolly
Dog. “But tell me—is this a good place
to live? You see, I just came and I don’t
know much about the family.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“Why, yes, it’s a very good place,” said
the Chinese Man. “Of course, Jane is a
bit mischievous, but she’ll get over that.
Donald isn’t so bad, for a boy. Of course
he shouts a lot.”</p>

<p>“All boys do that,” said the Woolly
Dog. “You should have heard them on
the street where I was in a store. I suppose
you were in a store yourself?” he
suggested.</p>

<p>“Once upon a time, many years ago,”
said the Chinese Man who was a needle
case. “It’s so long I have almost forgotten.
But I think you’ll like it here if you
can keep away from Jane. Once she took
off my head and dropped it in the goldfish
bowl.”</p>

<p>“She did?” cried the Woolly Dog.
“Did they bite you—those goldfish, I
mean?”</p>

<p>“They tried to,” laughed the Chinese
Man. “But I have a very hard head and
they only broke off their teeth, so they
stopped.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“My, that was a wonderful adventure!”
barked the Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was,” agreed the Chinese Man,
as he rattled the needles inside him.
“Luckily I can hold my breath a long
time, so I didn’t take in any water, and
Mrs. Cressey saw what had happened and
fished me out. After that she put me up
on this shelf where Jane couldn’t get me.”</p>

<p>“I wish they’d keep me on a shelf,”
sighed the Woolly Dog. “Oh, but I’m all
cut up.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, I heard Mrs. Cressey say
she was going to sew you up,” said the
Chinese Man. “And she is very clever
with her needle—very. You should see
her sew buttons on Donald’s clothes.”</p>

<p>“Does he need many sewed on?”</p>

<p>“Does he? Say, I never saw a boy
burst so many buttons off his clothes!
It’s a wonder to me he doesn’t fly apart.
I remember——”</p>

<p>But suddenly the Chinese Man stopped
talking and the Woolly Dog, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
around to learn the reason, saw Mrs.
Cressey coming into the room, followed
by Donald.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll sew up your Woolly Dog,”
said the little boy’s mother.</p>

<p>That was the reason the Chinese Man
could no longer talk, nor could the Woolly
Dog. There were human beings present.</p>

<p>But the Dog was glad he had made a
new friend in the house, and he thought
that after dark, when everyone was
asleep, he could come and visit the Chinese
Man and hear more stories. Perhaps
there were other toys with whom he might
play when the house was quiet.</p>

<p>“Now to mend your birthday Dog,”
said Donald’s mother.</p>

<p>She threaded a needle, taking one from
the china case, lifting off the head of the
Chinese Man to do so.</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s what he meant by his head
coming off!” thought the Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cressey first carefully poked back
inside the Woolly Dog the cotton stuffing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
that Jane had pulled out when searching
for the Dog’s “bark.” Then Donald’s
mother, taking very fine stitches so they
would not show, mended the gash in the
Dog’s stomach.</p>

<p>While she was doing this she tickled
the Woolly Dog quite a bit. He wanted
to squirm and wiggle and even bark, but
he dared do none of these things, for both
Donald and his mother were looking at
him.</p>

<p>“There you are, Donald,” said Mrs.
Cressey, at last. “You can hardly tell
where he was cut. Your birthday Dog is
as good as ever.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother! I’m so glad!” cried the
little boy. “Now I can play with him and
have fun.”</p>

<p>The Woolly Dog was glad to feel himself
in Donald’s arms again, and he hoped
Jane would let him alone.</p>

<p>“But, all the same,” thought the Woolly
Dog to himself, “there is a queer, ticklish
feeling inside me. I’m not the same Dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
I was before, and I know it. That queer,
tickling feeling—I wonder what it is?”</p>

<p>But there seemed no way of finding out.</p>

<p>When Donald’s father came home that
evening the new toy was shown to him,
and he was told what Jane had done.
Jane was a little ashamed of herself and
hung her head.</p>

<p>“I not hurt your Doggie any more,
Don,” she promised.</p>

<p>That evening, after supper, the two
children played with their toys, and Donald
even let Jane hold his Woolly Dog for
a while. And Jane was very careful.</p>

<p>“But it’s the funniest thing about that
tickling feeling inside my ribs,” thought
the Dog to himself. “I didn’t have it before
Jane cut me open.</p>

<p>“I guess some of my cotton stuffing
didn’t get put back just straight, as it was
before,” he thought. “Well, no matter, I
suppose I ought to consider myself lucky
not to be in the hospital.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” called Donald to Jane.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
“I’ll put my Woolly Dog on the train of
cars and give him a ride.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’ll be fun!” laughed Jane.</p>

<p>“Gracious! A ride on the cars!”
thought the Woolly Dog. “That will be
a new adventure for me!”</p>

<p>And he liked riding on Donald’s toy
train very much.</p>

<p>Then night came and the children had
to go to bed. The Woolly Dog was put
on a shelf in the playroom with other toys,
some of which Donald and Jane had received
for Christmas.</p>

<p>It was when Mrs. Cressey was getting
ready for bed that she suddenly looked
at her left hand and exclaimed to her husband:</p>

<p>“Oh, my diamond engagement ring is
gone!”</p>

<p>“It is?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I must have dropped it on the
floor! Oh, help me look for it! I wouldn’t
lose that for anything!”</p>

<p>But though they looked on the floors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
of several rooms, the missing diamond
ring was not found.</p>

<p>“When did you have it last?” asked
Mr. Cressey.</p>

<p>“I wore it all day,” answered his wife.
“I had it on when Brother Theodore was
here, and in all the excitement about
Don’s Dog. I had it on when I sewed up
the Dog and when I ate supper, for I remember
it very well.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it dropped off in the soup,”
suggested Mr. Cressey.</p>

<p>“No, for then I’d have seen it on my
plate. Oh, where is my diamond ring?”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<span class="fs80">THE CHINA CAT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Besides being very valuable, Mrs. Cressey’s
diamond ring was highly prized because
it was her engagement token, given
her before her marriage. There were
tears in her eyes as she looked through the
different rooms for the missing jewel.</p>

<p>“Don’t feel so bad about it,” said her
husband. “I’m sure we’ll find it.”</p>

<p>But they did not find it that night, and
the next morning the search was kept up.
Donald and Jane, when told what had
happened, also joined in hunting for the
diamond ring, and Donald even looked
among his toys, thinking it might be there.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t, nor was it among Jane’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
dolls and other playthings where the little
girl looked.</p>

<p>“I’ll buy you another ring,” said Mr.
Cressey.</p>

<p>“Oh, I never could have but <em>one</em> engagement
ring,” sighed his wife, with tears in
her eyes. “I want my own ring back!”</p>

<p>However, it could not be found, search
as they did. Mrs. Cressey could not imagine
where she had dropped it, for that is
how she thought it must have become lost,
since she had not been out of the house.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it will turn up somewhere
in one of the rooms some day,” said Mr.
Cressey, as he went to the office. He felt
sad on his wife’s account.</p>

<p>Now I must tell you a little of what the
Woolly Dog did the first night he spent
in the home of Donald. As I have mentioned,
after supper the birthday toy was
put on a shelf in the playroom. Other
toys were there, and in the middle of the
room was a large Rocking Horse.</p>

<p>“I see we have a new one among us,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
said a Jack-in-the-Box, when night had
come and the toys were allowed to pretend
to come to life. “There is a new toy
among us, friends.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the Woolly Dog?” asked
a Celluloid Doll which had been given
Jane for Christmas.</p>

<p>“Yes, I mean the Woolly Dog,” answered
the Jack-in-the-Box. “How do
you do, Mr. Dog?” he went on. “And
how do you like it here? We always ask
new toys that,” he said politely.</p>

<p>“I like it very well,” answered the
Woolly Dog. “Of course, I don’t know
much about this place yet, and I hardly
feel that I know Donald at all. As for
Jane——”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of Jane!” cried the Celluloid
Doll. “Asking your pardon for interrupting
you,” she went on to the Dog.
“But that Jane is a tyke, if ever there
was one.”</p>

<p>“You should see what she did to me!”
barked the Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>“Tell us!” begged a Paper Doll.</p>

<p>And the Woolly Dog told about being
cut open.</p>

<p>“That’s even worse than what happened
to me,” sighed the Celluloid Doll.</p>

<p>“What happened to you?” inquired the
Dog, for he thought it only polite to show
an interest in the troubles of other toys.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jane dropped me and smashed my
nose,” said the Doll. “There’s a dent in
it that will never come out. My beauty
is spoiled forever! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” said the Dog. “But tell
me—have you a ticklish feeling inside
you?”</p>

<p>The Celluloid Doll gave herself a little
shake.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t feel ticklish,” she answered,
after thinking a moment. “That
doesn’t mean I want you to tickle me,
though!” she exclaimed, jumping away as
a Donkey from a Noah’s Ark walked over
toward her, wagging his ears.</p>

<p>“Have any of you toys a ticklish feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
inside you?” asked the Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>One after another the different toys
said they had not.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s very strange,” went on the
Woolly Dog. “I didn’t have it in the
store, but since my accident I feel like
laughing all the while.”</p>

<p>“That’s a jolly good way to feel, I
should think,” observed a Tin Soldier.
“Too many of us are gloomy and sad. I
am not, even if I have to go to war, but to
feel like laughing all the while—right
jolly I call that!”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t if you had a place that
wanted scratching and you couldn’t reach
it to scratch,” declared the Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>“Is that how you feel?” asked the Celluloid
Doll.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply. “I’m ticklish
all the while lately. But don’t let my
trouble worry you. Let’s have some fun,”
he proposed.</p>

<p>“Let’s ride on the Rocking Horse!”
suggested the Jack-in-the-Box. “Did you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
ever ride on a Rocking Horse?” he asked
the Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>“No,” was the answer. “But last
night, in the store, I gave the Rubber
Clown a ride on my back—that is, I did
after he stopped bouncing up and down.
Ha! Ha! That was funny!”</p>

<p>“Tell us about it,” begged the Paper
Doll, and the Dog did.</p>

<p>The other toys laughed and all of them
said the Woolly Dog was a jolly chap.
They were glad he had come to live among
them, and after some more talk the toys
began moving about more freely, for they
could do this when no human eyes watched
them.</p>

<p>“Do you mind if we ride on your back?”
asked the Jumping Jack of the Rocking
Horse. “I have only one leg,” he added,
“so I shan’t be very heavy.”</p>

<p>“How did you lose your leg?” asked the
Woolly Dog. “Was it in war?” and he
looked at the Tin Soldier.</p>

<p>“No, it was Jane’s fault,” said the one-legged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
Jumping Jack. “I belong to Donald,
but one day Jane tried to grab me
away from her brother. She got hold of
one leg and pulled and pulled and pulled
until she pulled it off. Oh, what a day
that was!”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you have it glued on again?”
asked the Dog.</p>

<p>“Well, they tried it,” answered the
Jumping Jack. “But they must have
used the wrong kind of glue, for my leg
broke off and was lost down a crack.
Since then I’ve had only one leg.”</p>

<p>“You are worse off than I am,” barked
the Woolly Dog. “I have all four legs
even if I was cut open and have a ticklish
feeling inside.”</p>

<p>The Rocking Horse began tilting to and
fro.</p>

<p>“If you toys are going to ride on my
back, you’d better begin,” he neighed.
“It will soon be morning.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said the Jack-in-the-Box.
“Daylight will soon be here and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
we’ll have to grow stiff and silent. Hurray
for a ride on the Rocking Horse!”</p>

<p>The Rocking Horse was so large that
all the toys could get on his back at once.
This they did, mounting one after another.
Jack-in-the-Box helped up the one-legged
Jumping Jack, and soon they were
all having a jolly ride around the playroom.</p>

<p>“My, I’m glad I came here to live,”
said the Woolly Dog, as he laughed at the
funny look on the Celluloid Doll’s face
while the Rocking Horse galloped around
a curve.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think you will like it,” remarked
the Paper Doll. And then she
suddenly cried: “Quick! Catch me!
I’m slipping! I’m going to fall!”</p>

<p>“I have you,” chattered a little Stuffed
Monkey, and, putting out a hairy hand, he
caught hold of the Paper Doll.</p>

<p>“Well, this is the last time I can ride
you around,” neighed the Horse. “I see
daylight coming.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>A final merry ride was given the toys
and then they all had to scurry back to
their places, for Donald or Jane might
come in any moment. And, a little later,
the children entered the playroom.</p>

<p>All that day Donald and his sister
played with the Woolly Dog and other
toys. They took some of their playthings
out on the porch, and other children living
near by came over to join in the fun.</p>

<p>A little girl named Dorothy had a Sawdust
Doll, and Dick, her brother, had a
Rocking Horse almost as large as Donald’s
on which the toys had ridden in the
night.</p>

<p>Another boy named Arnold owned a
Bold Tin Soldier, and Mirabell, his sister,
had a Lamb on Wheels. Then there was
Madeline with a Candy Rabbit, Archie
with a Stuffed Elephant, Herbert who had
a Monkey on a Stick, and Sidney with a
Calico Clown.</p>

<p>But of all the toys Donald’s Woolly
Dog was the newest and freshest. Once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
when the children went into the house to
get some bread and jam, leaving the toys
alone, they talked among themselves, and
the Sawdust Doll and the Tin Soldier
told of some adventures they had gone
through—adventures, they said, which
had been made into books.</p>

<p>“Do you think I’ll ever have a book
made about me?” asked the Woolly
Dog.</p>

<p>“Maybe, some day,” answered the
Stuffed Elephant. “But first you must
have lots of adventures.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they’ll put me in a book
even if I have a tickling feeling inside?”
barked the Dog.</p>

<p>“Oh, that doesn’t matter,” replied the
Elephant. “It’s a mere trifle.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t call it a trifle if you had
it,” said the Dog.</p>

<p>Then the children came back and the
toys had to keep quiet. For many days
Donald played with his Woolly Dog. For
many days Mrs. Cressey looked for her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
lost diamond ring without finding it.</p>

<p>Each night the Woolly Dog was put in
the playroom with the other toys, but one
night Donald forgot his Dog and left him
in the front hall. There Susan the maid
found him.</p>

<p>“I declare!” exclaimed Susan, “Donald
has forgotten his birthday toy that his
Uncle Teddy gave him. I’ll put him in
the hall closet with the umbrellas,” and
she did, meaning to tell Donald in the
morning.</p>

<p>“Dear me! This isn’t a very nice place
to be shut up in,” thought the Woolly
Dog, as he found himself in the umbrella
closet. “And what a funny smell,” he
went on. “I say,” he called aloud, “are
you here, Mr. Clown? I seem to smell
you.”</p>

<p>“It’s the rubbers and overshoes you
smell,” said a voice. “They are made of
rubber as, I suppose, is the Clown you
speak of.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” barked the Woolly Dog.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
“But who are you?” he asked. “I can’t
make out where you are?”</p>

<p>“I’m down inside one of these umbrellas,”
was the answer. “If you will
give it a little jiggle I think I can get out.
I’m caught on one of the ribs.”</p>

<p>“One of your ribs!” exclaimed the
Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>“No, one of the umbrella ribs. That’s
it—thank you,” went on the voice, and, as
the Woolly Dog shook the umbrella, out of
it crawled a Cat.</p>

<p>“Oh, bow wow! Gurr-r-r-r—rrr!”
barked the Woolly Dog. “Oh, a Cat! I
must chase you! Dogs always chase Cats!
Bow wow!”</p>

<p>“No, don’t chase me,” mewed the Cat.
“I am a toy like yourself. I am only a
China Cat. Don’t chase me, but hear my
sad story.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<span class="fs80">IN THE BEEHIVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Woolly Dog stopped short on hearing
this. He did not want to be unkind,
but, as he said, dogs always chased cats,
and he was a Dog, even if he was made of
lamb’s wool and stuffed with cotton.</p>

<p>“Don’t chase me,” mewed the China
Cat. “I am a toy, like yourself. I am
not real, and I have had, oh, such a sad
life.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, if you are a toy I
won’t chase you,” barked the Woolly
Dog. “I didn’t know you were one of
us. I thought you were a regular Cat.
You look like one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, for a China Cat I am well made,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
went on the other toy, as she snuggled
down on the floor of the closet among the
rubbers where the Woolly Dog had been
placed by Susan. “It isn’t very nice in
here, is it?” she went on.</p>

<p>“No,” agreed the Woolly Dog. “But
Donald will take me out in the morning.
And I rather like that rubbery smell—it
reminds me of the Clown and the time I
was in the store. But you spoke of a sad
story—tell me about it. We are by ourselves
now and can do as we please. How
long have you been here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have been shut up in this closet
over a week!” said the China Cat sadly.
“And it has been so lonesome! Tell me—you
belong to some little child, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the Woolly Dog. “To
a little boy named Donald.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am a child’s pet, too,” mewed
the Cat. “But I have been forgotten, I
guess. The children here had a party, and
I was one of the toys brought to it. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
the little child who owned me forgot me,
and I was tossed into the closet with a
pair of rubbers, into one of which I had
fallen. I bounced from the rubber into
the partly closed umbrella, and I’ve been
here ever since.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you crawl out some
night?” asked the Dog. “You could have
scrambled up inside the umbrella by your
claws, I should think.”</p>

<p>“I tried it,” said the China Cat. “But
each time I got tangled in the ribs and
stuck. It wasn’t until you came and gave
the umbrella a shake that I could get out.
I’m much obliged to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m glad I could help,” said the
Dog. “But now tell me your sad story.”</p>

<p>“It’s in a book, and you can read it if
you know how,” mewed the Cat. “But
I’ll tell you part of it. Once I was in a
store as you were, and there was a fire.
Oh, I was so black and dirty and smoky!
And I was stolen by a colored boy!”</p>

<p>“Oh, never!” barked the Dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I was!” insisted the China Cat.
“Then there was a flood and a terrible
time, but at last I was given a good home
and I lived happily until this misfortune
came. Now isn’t that a sad story?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” agreed the Dog. “But
when it comes to sad stories, I have one
of my own.”</p>

<p>“Do tell me,” begged the China Cat,
curling her whiskers. “I love sad stories.”</p>

<p>“Well,” began the Dog, “I have a ticklish
feeling inside me, and——”</p>

<p>“I don’t call <em>that</em> sad,” interrupted the
Cat, with a smile.</p>

<p>“You would if you had it,” barked the
Dog. “Tell me—were you ever cut open
and sewed together again?”</p>

<p>“No, never!” exclaimed the China Cat.</p>

<p>“Well, would you call that sad?”</p>

<p>“I certainly would, Mr. Woolly Dog.
Tell me more about it.”</p>

<p>Then the Dog told his story and the two
toy friends had a good time there in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
closet talking to one another. Morning
came and they had to keep quiet. Susan,
the maid, remembered about putting the
Woolly Dog away and opened the door
to take him out.</p>

<p>“Here, Donald, is your Dog,” she said.</p>

<p>Jane looked in and saw the China Cat.</p>

<p>“Oh, whose is that?” cried the little
girl. “I’m going to have it!”</p>

<p>But Jane’s mother remembered about
the child visitor who had lost the China
Cat. So she sent it home, and very glad
the Cat was to get back where she belonged.
The Woolly Dog was sad at losing
his new friend, but he hoped to see her
again.</p>

<p>In spite of good times at Donald’s
house there was always a little sadness because
of the lost diamond ring.</p>

<p>Those who were sad were Mr. and Mrs.
Cressey and it was because of the lost diamond
ring that the parents of Donald and
Jane were sad. As for the children, they
were having so much fun with their toys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
that after the first few days they gave no
more thought to the lost diamond.</p>

<p>“I know how we can have some fun,”
said Donald to Jane one day.</p>

<p>“How?” asked the little girl, who was
always ready for a good time.</p>

<p>“We’ll take some of our toys out on the
porch and play circus,” Donald answered.</p>

<p>Soon the children were playing this
game. The Woolly Dog was there, of
course, and so was a little Donkey that
could wiggle his ears and nod his head.
Donald also had a Wooden Tiger who
looked very fierce but who wouldn’t even
so much as bite your little finger if you
put it in his mouth. He was a very good
Tiger, even if he did look fierce.</p>

<p>“I’ll make my Woolly Dog do tricks,”
said Donald.</p>

<p>He found a small wooden hoop and
Susan kindly pasted some paper over it
for the little boy.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll make my Dog jump through
the hoop the way they do in the circus,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
said Donald. And, as truly as I am telling
you, the Woolly Dog really burst
through the paper hoop.</p>

<p>Of course Donald tossed the Dog, but
it looked very natural, and Jane clapped
her hands in delight.</p>

<p>“Now make believe your Dog is a
horse and let my Celluloid Doll ride on
his back,” proposed Jane.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’ll be fun!” laughed Donald,
and this was done. The Celluloid Doll
looked like a real circus bareback rider.</p>

<p>But, after a while, the children became
tired of playing circus.</p>

<p>“What else can we do?” asked Jane.</p>

<p>Donald thought for a moment and he
was about to say they might make mud
pies when a playmate from down the
street came running up crying:</p>

<p>“Oh, Don! Oh, Jane! There’s a hand-organ
man and a monkey around the corner!
Come and see him!”</p>

<p>Away ran Donald and Jane, leaving
their toys on the porch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, such children!” sighed Susan, as
she came out and saw the playthings. “I
must pick them up or some street boys
might take them.”</p>

<p>Susan thought she picked up everything,
but the Woolly Dog had fallen behind
a post out of sight, and the maid did
not see this toy. So the Dog was left on
the porch.</p>

<p>A little later two bad boys came along.
One of them, looking over the fence, saw
the Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>“I’m going to take that,” he said.</p>

<p>“Better not,” warned the other.</p>

<p>“Sure I will,” said the first. “No one
will see me.” He went slyly into the yard
and picked up the Woolly Dog. “This is
a dandy!” he exclaimed, pawing the clean
white wool of the Dog with his dirty
hands. “I’ll take him home.”</p>

<p>The bad boys started home with Donald’s
Woolly Dog, but they had not gone
far down the street before, looking back,
the second boy cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“Here comes a policeman! He’s after
you because you took that Dog!”</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” cried the boy who had Donald’s
toy. “I’m going to run!”</p>

<p>And run both boys did. But still the
policeman came on. Now, as a matter of
fact, the policeman was not after the boys
at all. He was hurrying down the street
to go home to his dinner, and he did not
know the boys had stolen the Dog. But
the boys thought he was after them, and so
they ran.</p>

<p>Down a lane that led to the country fled
the boy with the Woolly Dog, and still the
policeman came on, for he lived in that
neighborhood.</p>

<p>“He’s going to catch you,” said the boy
who had not taken the Dog.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll get rid of this,” cried the
other, and he gave the Woolly Dog a toss
over the fence. Then the two boys ran
on and hid themselves in a wood, but the
policeman turned into his house to get his
dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, dear me! This is terrible!”
thought the Woolly Dog, when he felt
himself being taken away by the bad boy.
“And this is worse,” thought the Dog, as
he felt himself flung over the fence. Then,
as he landed down inside what seemed to
be a box, he barked: “And <em>this</em> is the
worst of all!”</p>

<p>Well might he say that, for he had been
thrown into a hive of bees!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<span class="fs80">RIDING DOWN HILL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>There was a little farm in the country
not far from Donald’s home, and the
farmer kept a few hives of bees for the
honey they made. This farmer happened
to be out working among his bees when
the boy who had stolen the Woolly Dog
ran past. And when the boy, to get rid
of the Dog, threw the toy over the fence,
why, Donald’s plaything fell right into
an open hive of the honey-making and
stinging insects.</p>

<p>For bees can sting as well as make
honey, you know.</p>

<p>“Yes, this certainly is the worst of all
my adventures!” thought the Woolly Dog,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
as he found himself among the crawling
bees. “It is even worse than when Jane
cut me open with the scissors and I was
sewed up again. Oh, what a tickling feeling!”</p>

<p>Well might the Woolly Dog say this,
for now he was being tickled on the outside
by the bees crawling over him, and he
already had a tickling feeling inside,
though from what he did not know.</p>

<p>“These bees will sting me to death!”
thought the Woolly Dog. “They certainly
will sting me to death! I heard
one of the animals, in the Noah’s Ark that
Donald has, talking about bees. I think
it was the Wooden Elephant. He said
bees were dreadful stingers.”</p>

<p>As for the bees they were much excited.
They always grew excited when the farmer
took the top off their hive, as he had
just done, to get some of the honey for
himself. Here and there crawled the
buzzing, humming bees. They had a
Queen, and the Queen called:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“What is this that has fallen among us?
If it is anyone but the kind farmer after
our honey, just sting him, my children!
We will not sting the farmer, for he is
kind to us and puts us in a warm place
in winter. But if it is anyone else, sting
him!”</p>

<p>“It is someone else, Your Majesty,” answered
a busy bee. “This creature is
large and fuzzy—not as large as the
farmer but more fuzzy.”</p>

<p>“Sting him!” ordered the Queen bee.</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t sting me!” begged the
Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>“Stop! Wait a minute!” commanded
the Queen. “The creature speaks our
language. Perhaps he means no harm,”
for the Dog, you see, had spoken the language
of animals and insects, there being
no human beings there to spy on him.</p>

<p>“Certainly I mean you no harm,”
barked the Woolly Dog. “I am sorry if
I disturbed you, but I couldn’t help it.
A bad boy tossed me in among you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>By this time a number of the strongest
bees had gotten ready to sting the Woolly
Dog in answer to their Queen’s command,
but now Her Majesty, who was a longer,
thinner bee than any of the others, walked
daintily toward the Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>“What a queer creature he is, to be
sure,” said the Queen. “So very large
and fuzzy, as you said, my children. Not
as large as the farmer, but truly much
more fuzzy.”</p>

<p>“Big as he is, Your Majesty,” growled
one of the worker bees, “we can all sting
him if you say so. But it will be hard
work. His fuzzy coat of wool will tangle
in our legs. But we can sting him on his
nose—he has no fuzz there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t sting me on my nose! Don’t,
please, sting me on my nose!” howled the
Woolly Dog, and he began hiding his nose
down in his paws.</p>

<p>“No, don’t sting him,” ordered the
Queen. “He is one of us. But I must ask
you, Mr. Woolly Dog,” she went on,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
“please to get out of our hive, for you are
in the way. I don’t want to be impolite,
but you are in the way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll get out fast enough, I promise
you,” said the Dog, but he wondered
how in the world he was ever going to get
back to Donald’s house all by himself.
Here was a dreadful adventure!</p>

<p>The Woolly Dog was about to jump out
of the beehive when suddenly the Queen
called:</p>

<p>“Here comes the farmer!”</p>

<p>Then the Dog knew he dared not move,
for that was not allowed when human eyes
saw him.</p>

<p>Up came the farmer to put the cover
back on the beehive, after having taken
out what honey he wanted. The farmer
looked, rubbed his eyes, and looked again.</p>

<p>“Well, bless my stars!” he exclaimed.
“A toy Woolly Dog in my beehive! I
wonder how it got there? Some children
must have been out here playing while I
was in the house, and they tossed their dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
there. It’s a wonder they weren’t stung.
Well, unless I want a honey Dog, I’d better
take him out.”</p>

<p>The farmer lifted the Woolly Dog from
the hive and laid him on the ground.
Then the top of the beehive, or house, was
put in place, and the bees began working
again at gathering more honey for the
man. The Queen bee started to lay more
eggs to hatch out more bees, and she
laughed to herself as she thought of the
visitor to her hive.</p>

<p>“He certainly was a queer chap—so
fuzzy,” hummed the Queen. “And how
he would have howled if my children had
stung him on his little black nose. But
perhaps it is just as well they didn’t.”</p>

<p>So the Woolly Dog got through that adventure
rather well, I think, but still he
was far from home—that is, far for him,
as he was not as large as a real dog.</p>

<p>“I’ll take you up to the house,” said the
farmer, talking to himself, but looking at
Donald’s toy. “You are a pretty handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
toy,” he bee-keeper went on. “But
you must have been in a war,” he added,
with a laugh, as he turned the Dog over
and saw where he had been cut and sewed
up. “Yes, you certainly must have been
in a war!”</p>

<p>As the farmer reached the house, his
wife came out with a basket of eggs. She
saw in his hand the Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>“Where did you get that?” asked the
farmer’s wife, in surprise.</p>

<p>“I found it in one of my beehives. Put
it away until Mary comes to visit us and
we’ll give it to her baby.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” exclaimed his wife.
“Why, that Woolly Dog belongs to Donald
Cressey!”</p>

<p>“Not the Cressey we sell eggs and honey
to?” cried the farmer, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, the very same one,” said his wife.
“I remember the last time I took eggs
there I saw Donald playing with his Dog.
His uncle, Mr. Blakeley, gave it to him.”</p>

<p>“Well, if this is Donald’s Dog I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
want it,” said the farmer. “I wonder
how it got in my beehive, though. Do you
think Donald is around here?”</p>

<p>“No; I’m sure he wouldn’t come away
out here alone, and none of his folks has
been here. But I am going to his house
now with these eggs, and I’ll take the
Woolly Dog back.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the farmer, and the
Woolly Dog was placed in the basket of
eggs. He was so soft and fluffy that he
did not break a one, even though he
bounced around on them as the farmer’s
wife drove to town in the donkey cart.
The place where the bees were kept was a
little way beyond the suburb of the city in
which Donald lived.</p>

<p>“More adventures!” thought the Woolly
Dog, as he was jiggled and joggled
about on the eggs in the basket. “Will
they never end? And that ticklish feeling
inside me—I wonder if it could have been
caused by the bees’ legs? No, it couldn’t!
For I felt ticklish inside before that bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
boy tossed me into the beehive. And, anyhow,
the bees tickled me on the outside,
not on the inside. Well, it can’t be helped,
I suppose.”</p>

<p>You can imagine how surprised Donald
and his sister were when the “Egg Lady,”
as they called the farmer’s wife, brought
back the Woolly Dog. Donald had missed
his plaything from the porch on coming
back after having gone to see the hand-organ
man and monkey, and when he told
his mother what had happened she said:</p>

<p>“Someone must have come in and have
taken your dog,” for Susan did not remember
having picked it up with the other
toys.</p>

<p>“But how it got in our beehive, we can’t
guess,” said the “Egg Lady.”</p>

<p>“Some boy must have taken it off our
porch and then have gotten tired of carrying
the Dog,” said Mrs. Cressey. “Then
he tossed him over the fence.” And that
is just the way it happened, except that
the bad boy was afraid of the policeman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
and that’s why he threw away the Woolly
Dog.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the Dog was back home again,
and much pleased to be there, too. That
night, when he was put in the playroom
with the other toys, the Woolly Dog told
of his adventure, and all the others listened
eagerly.</p>

<p>From then on, nearly every day, something
happened to the Woolly Dog, with
whom Donald liked to play. Once Donald
took the Dog for a sail on a board raft
in a puddle of water and the Dog fell in.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s drowned!” cried Donald, but
another boy fished out the Dog and Mrs.
Cressey washed him clean and dried him
by the stove.</p>

<p>Another time a real dog ran into the
yard, picked up the Woolly Dog and
started to run away with him. But Donald
and Jane chased the real dog and got
back the Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>Summer passed and fall came, bringing
new adventures to the toy Dog. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
winter, with its snow and ice, arrived.</p>

<p>“Hurray! Now we can ride down hill
on our sleds!” cried Donald and Jane,
after the first snow.</p>

<p>“I’m going to take my Dog,” said Donald.</p>

<p>“Don’t lose him,” cautioned his mother.</p>

<p>“I won’t,” promised Donald. But he
did. He had the Woolly Dog on his sled
with him, and, in steering around a curve,
the sled upset and Donald fell off. But
this was not the worst: The Woolly Dog
was tossed into a big bank of soft snow!</p>

<p>Deep down into the snowdrift sank the
Woolly Dog, out of sight, growing colder
and colder all the while.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE LOST IS FOUND</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Look at Donald! Look at Donald!”
laughingly shouted the other children who
were coasting on the hill. “Donald fell
off his sled!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care! It was fun!” and Donald
also laughed. “Did you see me roll
over?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, we saw you,” replied the other
boys and girls.</p>

<p>“Did you get hurt?” asked Jane.</p>

<p>“No, it was fun,” said Donald.</p>

<p>“Then I’m going to do it!” announced
his sister. “I’m going to ride down hill
and upset the way you did, Don.” Jane
was very venturesome as well as mischievous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“No, you mustn’t do it!” Donald said.
“Mother wouldn’t like it. She might
make us come in. Don’t upset, Jane.”</p>

<p>“All right, I won’t—not on purpose,”
she answered, with a laugh. “But if I
happen to I can’t help it,” she added.
“Can I?” Jane had gotten over speaking
“baby talk.”</p>

<p>And, really, I believe Jane would have
been glad to upset off her sled as Donald
had done, and she might have given herself
a little push to bring this about, but
that she happened to notice that her
brother did not have the Woolly Dog after
he had picked himself up, following the
upset.</p>

<p>“Oh, where is he?” cried Jane.</p>

<p>“Who?” inquired Donald.</p>

<p>“The Woolly Dog you had riding with
you. He’s gone!”</p>

<p>Then, for the first time since the accident,
Donald noticed that his birthday toy
was missing.</p>

<p>“He was on my sled in front of me,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
he said. “He must have fallen off when
I went around the curve.”</p>

<p>“Come on, I’ll help you look for him,”
offered Jane.</p>

<p>But though she and Donald and the
other children searched all around in the
snow for the Woolly Dog they could not
find him. He had been tossed off the overturned
sled and had bounced into the middle
of a snow bank some distance away,
falling deep down into the soft pile of
flakes. The children did not see him at
all.</p>

<p>“Burr-r-r-r! But it’s cold!” shivered
the Woolly Dog, as he found himself in the
midst of the snowdrift. “Oh, what a
dreadful adventure this is going to be!
It’s worse than falling into the mud puddle
and it’s almost as bad as being cut and
sewed up again! I wonder what is going
to happen to me?”</p>

<p>The Woolly Dog did not know. He
could hear Donald, Jane and the other
boys and girls talking as they searched for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
him. The Woolly Dog wished he might
call out and tell them where he was so they
could lift him from his cold, white bed
among the flakes of snow, but this was not
allowed. He could not move or speak
when human beings were present.</p>

<p>“But it certainly is dreadfully cold
here!” whined the Woolly Dog to himself.
“Oh, burr-r-r-r! It’s freezing!”</p>

<p>It was a good thing he was covered with
warm lamb’s wool. If he had been one of
those skinny dogs, like a greyhound or a
Mexican hairless terrier, I’m sure our
friend would have frozen stiff in a few
minutes. But, being a Woolly Dog, or
“fuzzy,” as the Queen Bee had called
him, this kept him warmer.</p>

<p>“Oh, but my nose is so cold!” sighed
the Woolly Dog, and that, not being covered
with wool, was very frosty indeed.
Of course, you know a real dog’s nose
should always be cold. When your dog’s
nose is warm it is a sign that he is ill and
has a fever. But when the Woolly Dog’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
nose was cold, that was a sign he was
frosty.</p>

<p>“I’ll try to warm it,” he said to himself.
And, being out of sight among the
snowflakes, he put his cold little black
nose down between his paws. Then it felt
a little warmer and he listened to hear
what was going on. He heard no sound.</p>

<p>Donald, Jane and the other children,
having searched for the Woolly Dog without
finding him, saw that it was getting
late, and they ran home. Donald was almost
ready to cry over his lost toy, for he
liked the Woolly Dog very much.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” consoled Jane, “maybe
Uncle Teddy will buy you another, just
as Daddy is going to buy Mother another
diamond ring for the one she lost.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want a new Woolly Dog! I
want my old one!” exclaimed Donald.</p>

<p>In this he was like his mother, who
wanted her engagement ring back, and
not a new one. But the lost diamond had
never been found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>Donald, almost in tears, told his mother
of the accident on the hill and about his
lost Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Mrs. Cressey, “to-morrow
I’ll go out there with you, when
it’s daylight, and perhaps we shall find
him.”</p>

<p>But Donald was a sad little boy when
he went to bed that night.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we must see what is happening
to the Woolly Dog. For some time he
lay there in the snow, warming his cold
nose. Then, as the voices of the children
grew quiet—for they had gone away—the
Dog said:</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can wiggle out of here. No
one can see me now.”</p>

<p>He kicked around in the snow with his
paws, but all he did was to toss snow up
his nose, and this made him sneeze. And
when he sneezed it made the tickling feeling
inside him grow worse, so that he
wanted to laugh and scratch and sneeze,
all at the same time. And this, I think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
you will agree with me, is too much for
any Dog, Woolly or not.</p>

<p>“No use! I can’t get out of here!”
sighed the Woolly Dog. But still he did
not give up. He was kicking around a
bit more when, suddenly, he heard a voice
saying:</p>

<p>“Here’s a hole in the snow! Maybe a
rabbit went down here!”</p>

<p>“It’s a boy!” thought the Woolly Dog.
“But it doesn’t sound like Donald.”</p>

<p>Nor was it. A strange boy, walking
along near the coasting hill, had seen the
hole which the Woolly Dog had made
when tossed into the drift. Thinking it
was a place where a rabbit had dived in,
the boy went closer to look. Then he saw
the Dog.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a rabbit!” cried the boy.
“And he isn’t moving! I guess he’s
frozen! I’ll take him home.”</p>

<p>The Woolly Dog, being white, looked a
little like a rabbit—that is, at first glance.
But when the boy reached his arm down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
in the snow bank and pulled up the object,
he saw what it was.</p>

<p>“Oh, only a toy dog!” cried the boy.
“But I’ll take him home! He’s a dandy!</p>

<p>“Mother, look what I found!” cried the
boy, whose name was Frank, as he hurried
into the house, carrying the Woolly
Dog. “Look!”</p>

<p>“Where did you get it, Frank?”</p>

<p>“In a snowdrift. He was down in a
hole on the coasting hill.”</p>

<p>“Then some little child playing there
must have lost the toy,” said Frank’s
mother. “And whoever it was will feel
bad about it. If you knew who owned the
Dog, Frank, you could take it to him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and if it was in a rich family
maybe they’d give me a reward—a lot of
money!” cried Frank, for he and his
mother were poor.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t want a reward for doing
what is right,” said Mrs. Ward. “But
as we don’t know to whom the Dog belongs,
put him on the mantel over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
stove to dry. You’re too big to play with
such toys.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I don’t want him for myself,” answered
Frank. “But I’m glad I found
him.”</p>

<p>The Woolly Dog was glad, too, and he
felt much better up over the warm stove
than down in the cold snowdrift. All
night the Woolly Dog stood on the mantel.
There were no other toys for him
to speak to or play with. There was a
match box, in the shape of an Alligator,
but the Alligator’s head was broken off
and he could not talk.</p>

<p>“It is very lonesome here,” said the
Woolly Dog aloud, in the middle of the
night.</p>

<p>“Tick-tock! Tick-tock!” went the
clock.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t talk to you,” sighed the
Dog, “for you only say the same thing
over and over again.” And this was true.
A clock is one of the most tiresome beings
in the world to talk to, and it is so busy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
that it never has time to play—it goes
“tick-tock” all the while.</p>

<p>“I can see I am not going to have a very
good time here,” said the Woolly Dog.
“There was more fun back in the store
with the poor toys.”</p>

<p>But still he had a few adventures. Once
he fell off the mantel into the scuttle of
coal when a door slammed too hard, and
Mrs. Ward had to put him in one of her
tubs of suds to wash him. Mrs. Ward did
washing to make a living, and Frank
worked in a store. Another time the
Woolly Dog was placed in a dark closet
out of the way, and there a big Rat got
hold of him, thinking he was something
good to eat.</p>

<p>“Oh, bah! You’re only stuffed with
cotton!” snarled the Rat, after he had
tried to drag the Woolly Dog into its hole.
“I can’t eat you!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it,” said the Woolly Dog.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>The Rat left the Woolly Dog on the
floor of the closet and went in search of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>something else to gnaw. The next morning
Frank, looking for his rubbers, as it
was raining, saw the Dog.</p>

<p>“I’ll put you back on the mantel,” said
the boy. “I wish I knew who owned you,
as they must miss you.”</p>

<p>For over a week the Woolly Dog remained
in the home of Mrs. Ward, and a
very lonesome week it was, for no one
played with the toy. The Woolly Dog was
growing very sad.</p>

<p>Then, one day, he heard outside a voice
he well knew. The voice asked:</p>

<p>“Will you have time to do some extra
washing this week, Mrs. Ward?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Cressey, I think so,” answered
Frank’s mother. “Won’t you
come in for a moment and get warm?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I will,” and Donald’s
mother, who had come to see about getting
the washing done, entered the very room
where the Woolly Dog stood on the mantel.</p>

<p>In another instant Donald’s mother saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
the Dog. Her eyes opened wide with
wonder.</p>

<p>“Oh, where did you get that?” she
cried.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Mrs. Ward.</p>

<p>“That Woolly Dog! It belongs to Donald—at
least, I’m sure it’s the same one
he lost in a snow bank. I can easily tell
by looking. If it’s Donald’s Dog it will
have an extra seam underneath where I
sewed him up after Jane cut him open.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward lifted the Woolly Dog
down.</p>

<p>“Oh,” thought the birthday toy, “suppose
she can’t find that seam? Then she
won’t know me and I’ll never get back
home again!”</p>

<span class="fs80">A STRANGE DISCOVERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Donald’s mother slowly turned over
the Woolly Dog. She looked carefully at
the under side of his stomach.</p>

<p>“Yes!” she exclaimed, “it’s the same
Dog. I know my stitches very well. This
is Donald’s toy! I suppose you won’t
mind my taking it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, not at all,” answered Mrs. Ward.
“Frank found him in a snow bank——”</p>

<p>“Just where Donald lost him off his
sled, I suppose!” exclaimed Mrs. Cressey.</p>

<p>“And he brought the toy home here,”
went on Mrs. Ward. “Frank is too big
for such playthings, and he often said he
wished he knew to whom the Dog belonged.
I’m so glad you have found him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>“Donald will be glad, also,” said Mrs.
Cressey.</p>

<p>She talked a little longer, arranging a
day for Mrs. Ward to come and wash, and
then Donald’s mother said:</p>

<p>“I want to reward Frank in some way.
I know he is fond of reading, for he told
me so one day when he was doing errands
for me. I have some books I’d like to
give him.”</p>

<p>“That will please him,” said Mrs.
Ward. “He likes books much better
than a Woolly Dog.”</p>

<p>“Well, everything seems to be turning
out for the best,” thought the Woolly
Dog, as Mrs. Cressey took him home. “If
I could get rid of that ticklish feeling inside
me I’d be very happy. But then one
mustn’t complain of small troubles. I’ve
gotten over some big ones—the beehive
and the snow bank.”</p>

<p>Donald was very glad to get his Woolly
Dog back.</p>

<p>“Oh, look, Jane!” he cried when his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
mother gave him his lost birthday plaything.
“My Woolly Dog has come home!”</p>

<p>“Where was he?” asked Jane.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cressey told where she had, by the
merest accident, found the Woolly Dog,
and Donald and his sister smoothed out
his rumpled woolly coat, for he had been
sadly mussed when the Rat dragged him
along in the closet.</p>

<p>“Oh, Don, I know what we ought to
do!” cried Jane.</p>

<p>“What?” asked her brother.</p>

<p>“We ought to have a little play party
for your Woolly Dog,” went on Jane.
“Always when somebody comes back after
they been away they have a party.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’ll be fun,” answered the little
boy.</p>

<p>The children ran to their mother.</p>

<p>“May we have a party?” begged Donald.</p>

<p>“For his Woolly Dog,” explained Jane.
“He ought to have a party because he was
lost and now he’s home again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>“Just a little party,” begged Donald.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess so!” laughed Mrs. Cressey.</p>

<p>And so the party was arranged for.
After some talk Mrs. Cressey suggested
that it would be nice to make it a “toy
party”—that is, each boy and girl who
came should bring his or her favorite toy.
And when this was told to Donald and
Jane they clapped their hands in delight.</p>

<p>The invitations were sent out. Dorothy
was to come with her Sawdust Doll and
Dick with his White Rocking Horse.
Sidney would bring his Calico Clown,
Herbert his Monkey on a Stick, Madeline
her Candy Rabbit, Arnold his Tin Soldier
and Mirabell her Lamb on Wheels.
There were to be other toys—the China
Cat, the Stuffed Elephant and many
more.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a fine time we’ll have!”
laughingly cried Jane.</p>

<p>“And there’s to be a cake with candles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
on!” exclaimed Donald. “For, as the
Woolly Dog was my birthday present, this
is a birthday party—sort of.”</p>

<p>At last the afternoon of the party came,
and with it arrived the boys and girls with
their toys and playthings. The Woolly
Dog was given a place of honor, standing
on a box in the middle of the table, next to
the cake with its blazing candles.</p>

<p>“This party is for my Woolly Dog,”
explained Donald to his guests.</p>

<p>“Hurray for the Woolly Dog!” cried
Herbert, and the boys and girls gave
three cheers.</p>

<p>The Woolly Dog wanted to thank them,
but he dared not. However, he tried not
to feel proud as all the other toys looked
at him. But it was a great honor—all
the toys said so later on.</p>

<p>Oh, but such fun as there was at the
Woolly Dog’s party! And then, all of a
sudden, something happened.</p>

<p>Just how, no one knew, but the Woolly
Dog fell over against the party cake and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
one of the blazing candles set fire to his
wool. It began to smoke and singe.</p>

<p>“Oh, your Woolly Dog’s on fire!”
shouted Arnold.</p>

<p>“If I only had my toy fire engine I
could put it out!” cried Sidney.</p>

<p>But at the word “fire,” Mrs. Cressey
rushed in. She saw at once what had happened,
and caught up the Woolly Dog.
Quickly she rolled him in a thick rug on
the floor, thus smothering the flames. The
fire was out almost before it started.</p>

<p>But when Mrs. Cressey unrolled the
Woolly Dog from the rug he was a sad
sight. Underneath, on his stomach, there
was a black and burned patch.</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall die! I know I shall die!”
thought the Woolly Dog. “This is certainly
the end of me!”</p>

<p>Donald saw what had happened to his
plaything.</p>

<p>“Oh, my poor Woolly Dog!” he cried.
“He’s no good any more!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I can fix him,” said Mrs. Cressey.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
“I have a piece of white lamb’s wool
up in the sewing room. I’ll cut off the
burned part and sew on a new piece.
Then your Dog will be as good as ever.”</p>

<p>“May we come up and watch you fix
him?” asked Mirabell, who owned a lamb
on wheels which had the same kind of wool
that was on the Dog.</p>

<p>“Yes, come up to the sewing room,”
answered Mrs. Cressey.</p>

<p>With her scissors she cut away the
burned wool. The Dog was brave. He
never uttered a whimper or a cry as the
scissors went snip—snip.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Cressey suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh, my! What’s this?”</p>

<p>“Did you cut yourself?” asked Donald.</p>

<p>“No. But look what I found inside
your Woolly Dog!” answered his mother.
“My lost diamond ring! It has been inside
the Dog all this while! My ring must
have slipped off my finger when I was
sewing up your Dog the time Jane cut
him, and I sewed my diamond up in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
cotton stuffing. Oh, how glad I am! My
lost diamond ring is found!”</p>

<p>And there it was, sparkling like a rainbow
inside the Woolly Dog. Mrs. Cressey
put the ring on her finger, a happy
smile was on her face, and she hugged the
Woolly Dog.</p>

<p>“I must telephone Daddy,” she said,
and when Mr. Cressey heard the good
news he, too, was glad.</p>

<p>Then Donald’s mother put the new
piece of wool in place of the burned patch,
she sewed the Dog together again and gave
him to Donald.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll finish the party!” shouted
the little boy.</p>

<p>Once again the Woolly Dog was placed
in the middle of the table, but this time
far enough away from the blazing candles
on the cake to be safe. The Calico Clown
looked strangely at the Dog. Perhaps
the Calico Clown remembered the time his
trousers were burned by a gas jet in the
toy store.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“Hurray for the Woolly Dog!” cried
the children.</p>

<p>“And hurray for Mother’s diamond
ring!” shouted Donald.</p>

<p>That night, when the party was over,
the Woolly Dog was placed in the playroom
with the other toys.</p>

<p>“What has happened to you?” asked
the Celluloid Doll. “You look different,
somehow or other.”</p>

<p>“I feel different,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s the new piece of wool that
was sewed on him,” said the Jack-in-the-Box,
after the Dog had told of his adventure.</p>

<p>“No, it doesn’t seem to be that,” said
the Celluloid Doll.</p>

<p>“I know what makes me look different,”
said the Woolly Dog. “It’s because
that ticklish feeling is gone. All the
while, after Jane cut me open and I was
sewed up, I had the queerest feeling. It
was as though I itched or tickled on the
inside.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>“What made it?” asked the Jumping
Jack.</p>

<p>“It was the diamond ring,” answered
the Woolly Dog. “That ring inside me
kept tickling me all the while. Now that
it’s out I no longer feel tickled.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” said the other toys.</p>

<p>“And I am very happy,” went on the
Woolly Dog. “Do you think I shall ever
be put in a book?” he asked the Jumping
Jack.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” answered the Jumping Jack.</p>

<p>And the Woolly Dog was put in a book.
This book is the story of his adventures,
and I hope you like it.</p>
